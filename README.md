# Borealis Server Manager #
* Utility designed to facilitate the deployment, management, and control of various kinds of dedicated gameservers.  Primarily focusing on SteamCMD-supported servers.
* This project was originally created using C# and various UI frameworks, but due to licensing changes and restrictions preventing Borealis from being as flexible as it could, the project was migrated over to the Blazor / Razor C# programming structure.  This allows more beautiful web-UI control of the software while making it easier to migrate the existing codebase over to the new software.
